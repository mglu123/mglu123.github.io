The discussion about whether NBA refs favor home team is very interesting. The surprising point that I found is the scatter plot of “Home Field Advantage in Major American Sports”. The plot shows very clearly that what does the home field advantage actually means, and it also clearly make a good comparison between different games. However, when I read the part of correct or incorrect calls, it is a little bit confusing. The incorrect for home field is also higher than the away team, but winning percentage is still higher. This may be due to the small sample size of the data (97 Vs. 69). Moreover, within a given sample size, I do not think the difference is significant. 


Variables are winning percentage, calls and team type (home or away). Author concerned team type and calls, even more about winning percentage. Potential variable can be the score difference when the game is about to end which may affect refs mind.

Thank you for your reading
